This is the repository for the code used in the manuscript  https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.24.20201111v2.article-metrics

The code can be run in parallel using the bash scripts found in simulation/code/
Analysis scripts can be found in the R markdown file simulation/dpmAnalysis_trialSim.Rmd 

The analysis directory contiains code used for ongoing downstream ananlysis of the simulation results.
